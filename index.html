			                        <p><p>There has been one idea that I have not stopped thinking about. My roommates and family can attest that I have been discussing it ad nauseum for years. I never knew how to implement it. I did not know where to start. But today, I finally can say I am on the path to making my dream become a reality. I present: Wordly.</p>
<p>Wordly is based on this idea of a <em>reverse dictionary</em>. I'll admit it. I have a lot of trouble conjuring up the best word to use in a sentence. Too many times I'm stuck with that 'tip of the tongue' feeling. I know my long, superfluously worded phrases have more succinct alternatives (Wordly should recommend me the word verbose), but looking for the perfect word is time-intesnive. A reverse dictionary would take a description I am thinking of and return words with related definitions. This would be an indespensible tool while writing essays, poetry, even these posts. </p>
<p>When I thought of this idea, I immiedietly turned to Google. Search results pointed me first to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_dictionary">Wikipedia</a>, as always, which showed me the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_dictionary">conceptual dictionary</a>. So, according to Wikipedia, Wordly is an attempt at constructing a <em>conceptual</em> dictionary rather than a <em>reverse</em> dictionary. I learned this idea is not that new, but I noticed that there were only a few examples of conceptual/reverse dictionaries. Most of them are in-print. One, however, was fairly promising. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.onelook.com/reverse-dictionary.shtml">OneLook.com</a> has cosntructed a reverse-dictionary from indexing over 100 different dictionaries. They say it works by using various "statistical language processing hacks." Overall, OneLook's performance is really good, but I want to see if I could do it better. </p>
<p>I caught the bug and am obsessed with deep learning - captivated by the different research papers while constantly thinking of new applications. A friend recently showed me the power of <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">recurrent neural networks</a> (RNNs). RNNs are interesting because they are unlike the conventional neural networks I have worked with. First, they deal with sequences. This is crazy cool. These RNN can now incorporate a time-step into the equation. I can envision numerous RNN applications: everything from playing <a href="http://blog.otoro.net/2015/03/28/neural-slime-volleyball/">video-games</a> (a sequence of moves) to learning <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04623">how to draw</a> (sequences of brush strokes). Second, RNN have an "internal memory." This is great for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. For humans to be able to read, we need to retain semantic information across sequences of words. To know that in the sentence, "In France, we spoke their native language," the word <em>language</em> refers to <em>French</em>, we need to remember we read the word <em>France</em>. </p>
<p>Thinking about RNNs, I recalled another interesting NLP tool: vectorized word embeddings. I first learned about word embeddings after Google released their <a href="https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/">word2vec</a> framework. At a high-level, what this does is it reads huge amounts of text and computes mathematical representation of words. These 'words' now are clustered basted on how close in meaning they are. What I find most fascinating is how these mathematical representations can be used in very simple operations. Additional and subtraction can find analogies between words. The most common example is
</p>
<div class="math">$$
v(king) - v(man) + v(woman) \approx v(queen)
$$</div>
<p>
Where <span class="math">\(v(word)\)</span> is the computed mathematical representation. This is one example of a possible computation on these word vectors. </p>
<p>For someone who thinks naturally in numbers and math, this was revolutionary. I used this framework to explore how my brain acts as a reverse dictionary. Each thought is a query; my brain performs some computation and if I'm correct, the ouput is the word I was looking for. We (my teammate <a href="https://github.com/tfollo">Tim</a> and I) used this process as the basis of how Wordly works. </p>
<p>First, we trasnsformed a vocabulary to a corresponding vector space. 
Then, we trained a recurrent neural network on a set of dictionary definitions. We had the network predict a definition's corresponding entry. The objective was to minimze the euclidian distance between the predicted vector and the true dictionary entry. </p>
<p><img alt="Wordly System Design" src="images/portfolio/wordly/wordly_diagram.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. System design for Wordly. We took our set of dictionary defintiions and entries and embedded them into vector space. This produced a training set and their corresponding training labels. We used a portion of this dataset to train the RNN. After training the RNN, we took the weights and built a searchable UI on top of it. </p>
<p>We coded the backend system with the Keras Python module. My thesis work is coded all in Theano, so this was like a walk in the park. </p>
<p>In the end, we were able to get a model that had an average Euclidian distance error of 2.063 on the test set. To visualize the performance I look at the words with the closest predictions:</p>

<p>This is a list of words with very specific defintions. However, many of these words have multiple definitions. For example cardamom has two definitions in our test set: "rhizomatous herb of India having aromatic seeds used as seasoning" and "aromatic seeds used as seasoning like cinnamon and cloves especially in pickles and barbecue sauces."
Wordly is able to understand the first definition and predicts cardamom as the first predicted word. But Wordly's confidence dwindles for the second definition and chili replaces cardamon as the closest word. </p>
<p>Vector embeddings of two words are close if they are semantically similar. We hypothesize that the fact that Wordly learns very specific words is that their these word embeddings are distributed farther apart from more commonly used words. Therefore, it is easier for the RNN to learn weights that predict vectors substantially different from majority of the other words in the training set. If this hypothesis is true, we would expect that the model performs the worst on the most common words. Below is a sampling of the three words that Wordly performed the worst on:</p>

<p>It logical that Wordly would have trouble learning the definitions for words humans even have difficulty defining.</p>
<p>On cursory glance, I would say that Wordly has mediocre performance. Unfortunately, an average euclidian distance error of ~2.06 is not fairly impressive. Most word embeddings have a nearest neighbor in the range of ~1.3 units. Thus, if we are predicting with an error radius of 2.06 it will be difficult to have the correct word be the first choice (or even in the top 10).  </p>
<p>However, all in all I would say I am proud of this first iteration. First off, we faced a couple of limitations. We had about a week to design and implement this system and a half a week of training the system (we trained on the Yale High Performance Computing Cluster). Training could take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes per epoch; therefore, we only were able to try out a few different models. Second, there is a lot of room for improvement. </p>
<p>For the sake of time and computational resources, we outsourced our word embeddings to <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-3520">Polyglot</a>. A friend recommended Polyglot to us because it provided easy to use word embeddings in a simple pickle file. The set embeded 100,000 vocabulary words into 64 dimensions.  Reflecting back, I would have liked to use a more substantial set. In future experiments, I plan to use Google's Word2Vec embeddings (3 million words into 300 dimensions) or a comparable dataset.  </p>
<p>Another disadvantage of Polyglot's dataset was their vocabulary list. Many words were proper nouns, poorly processed (e.g. words contained punctuation), or absent. This made it difficult to cross reference with our dictionaries. Compared to OneLook.com hundreds of dictionaries, we were only using three. In total, we had about 300,000 training examples and 100,000 testing examples. I would like to run experiments to see how the amount of data affects the model's performance. And I would like to increase the size of our dataset because I believe more linguistic diversity will help the model better generalize for user input. </p>
<p>Lastly, there are so many more RNN models to try. We did not get to explore nearly as many types of models as we had hoped to. I am very new to the ideas of RNNs and NLP and so I do not have as strong of an intuition. I would love to get my hands dirtier with more research. I've always wanted to try genetic algorithms, so maybe this will be my <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X99000328">chance</a>. </p>
<p>In conclusion, while I wish the system performed better, this is an unfortunate reality of research. Iteration is necessary for success. For a quick, first experiment however, I am estatic over the promise of this project. It is truly an incredible feeling to be able to take an idea you have cared for over the years and finally see it through fruition. And at the end of the day, that feeling mixed with the sincere joy of execution is what's important.</p>
