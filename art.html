    <h2>Algorithmic Agonisms: Antagonizing AI Hiring Interviews</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://jaredleekatzman.github.io/AI_hiringBooth/">
          Do you think you could be hired by an AI?
        </a><br>

        As artificial intelligence is incorporated into more and more aspects of society, often
        the public is left without notice,
        even when an AI is used for a important life decision such as access to a job opportunites.
        Through an interactive AI Hiring Booth, I invite participants to experience what
        it may feel like to be hired or rejected by an AI algorithm.
        As you go through the experience, I ask in what ways this can go wrong
        and what forms of resistance we may need to hold employers accountable
        to algorithmic discrimination and other harms.

    <h2>Roles for Computing in Social Change</h2>
    <p>
      Algorithmic injustices are pervasive: hiring
systems prioritizing applications based on gender,
algorithmic risk assessments discriminating on race,
automation resulting in greater economic inequality.
The potential harms of technology betray the need
for a more socially-just, equitable-minded, and
responsible-first practice of building technology.
</p>
<p>
This work is my attempt to reclaim the role
technology has in larger societal progress. Inspired
by “Roles for Computing in Social Change” by Abebe
et al. (2020), I weave algorithms with generative
art as a means to reflect on how we build technology
and what it says about society. I aspire for more
conversations, less solutions, and new insights.

<p>
Computational Justice is a generative art piece which explores the
ways institutions fail to address systemic sexism in the workplace.
</p>

<p>
This work produces visuals based on code derived from “Computational
Justice: Simulating Structural Bias and Interventions.” Simulating how
sexism spreads through social learning in small meetings, Momennejad
et al. (2019) show how initiatives, such as affirmative action, fall
short. Remediating the toll on gendered minorities requires changes
in how people confront sexist comments. Translating simulated remarks
to lines between perpetrators and victims, I trace how systemic sexism
consumes a workplace’s culture.

      How does the Internet influence our psyches? <br>
      How does it move beyond the screen into our physical world?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutual Wayfinding is a process for examining how the digital blurs into
      our internal-psychological and external-physical worlds.
      Abstract paintings are fed into a neural network to generate a story,
      which is then interpreted into a photograph that becomes the seed for
      a new passage. This feedback loop exaggerates subtle shifts to explore
      how information from the Internet is produced and consumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work is in collaboration with artists Terrill Warrenburg and
      Amanda Suarez who provided the abstract paintings and photographic
      interpretations, respectively.

      Mutual Wayfinding II is a generative text piece that interrogates how
      different online communities discuss pressing issues such as climate
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual neural networks are trained on a curation of either news,
      forum comments, or scientific papers that discuss climate change.
      The generated text acts as a mirror for the aggregate voices present
      in each dataset. By juxtaposing the disparate discourses around a
      topic, Mutual Wayfinding II explores how digital worlds can diverge on
      controversial issues.

    <p>
      When the Quintessence of Dust theater company put on a cabaret with
      songs written from source material on individuals’ struggles with
      mental health, no one who was interviewed showed up to the performance.
      Each one cited that they did not want to risk seeing their trauma
      displayed on stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ring of Keys Cabaret is a collaboration with NYC play-write Rachel
      Kunstadt that aims to break the stigma of mental health in the LGBTQ+
      community. An AI is trained on interviews with LGBTQ+ individuals,
      and through the ‘strength in numbers’, generalizes across responses
      so that no one story is ever on display. Turning classical views of
      privacy-breaching algorithms up-side down, we explore how technology
      can protect stories rather than exploit them.
